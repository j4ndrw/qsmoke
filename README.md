# QSmoke - an app that helps you keep track how many days you lasted without smoking

## Features

- [x] Automatic time tracker
- [x] Leaderboard (your best streaks)
- [ ] Persistent notifications (users shouldn't have to open the app to see their progress)
  - I'm too lazy to implement this. Maybe some other time
